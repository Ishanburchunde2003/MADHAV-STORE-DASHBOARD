## Problem Statement

Madhav Store, an online retailer, seeks to enhance their operational efficiency and decision-making by gaining deeper insights into their online sales across various regions in India. Despite maintaining comprehensive datasets in separate CSV files, the lack of a centralized analytics platform hampers their ability to effectively track and analyze sales performance.

## Expected Outcomes:

The Power BI dashboard is expected to deliver actionable insights that enable Madhav Store to:

- Monitor sales performance across different regions in India.
- Identify top-selling products, categories, and customer segments.
- Analyze sales trends and seasonality patterns to optimize inventory management.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and promotional activities.
- Forecast future sales and set strategic targets to drive business growth.
